<p style="text-align: justify;" dir="ltr"><strong>Background and Significance:</strong> Existing emotion datasets are mainly annotated categorically without an indication of degree of emotion. Further, the tasks are almost always framed as classification tasks (identify 1 among n emotions for this sentence). In contrast, it is often useful for applications to know the degree to which an emotion is expressed in text. This is the first task where systems have to automatically determine the intensity of emotions in tweets.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Task: </strong>Given a tweet and an emotion X, determine the intensity or degree of emotion X felt by the speaker -- a real-valued score between 0 and 1. The maximum possible score 1 stands for feeling the maximum amount of emotion X (or having a mental state maximally inclined towards feeling emotion X). The minimum possible score 0 stands for feeling the least amount of emotion X (or having a mental state maximally away from feeling emotion X). The tweet along with the emotion X will be referred to as an instance. Note that the absolute scores have no inherent meaning -- they are used only as a means to convey that the instances with higher scores correspond to a greater degree of emotion X than instances with lower scores.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paper:</strong> Participants will be given the opportunity to write a system-description paper that describes their system, resources used, results, and analysis. This paper will be part of the official <a href="http://optima.jrc.it/wassa2017/">WASSA-2017</a> proceedings. The paper is to be four pages long plus two pages at most for references. The papers are to follow the format and style files provided by <a href="http://emnlp2017.net">EMNLP-2017</a>.</p>
